## Introduction

The simulation and calculations are done in your web browser, so the answers to the questions stay with you, we do not collect any of them.

However, we do track some information about your use of this simulator, such as the pages consulted and the time spent, with the sole aim of improving it
the sole purpose of improving it.

In particular, we track the address of the page at the end of the simulation, which contains your total footprint and its breakdown into the main categories (transport, housing, etc.).

You can find out more and disable this tracking, which is done via a state instance of the open software Matomo, below.

The group simulation modes, conference and survey, use our servers to aggregate the multiple simulations and communicate them between the participants.

## Who is responsible for Nos Gestes Climat?

Nos Gestes Climat is being developed by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME). The Nos Gestes Climat digital platform uses a personal carbon footprint calculator to estimate the carbon footprint of users' consumption.
The Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME), represented by Mr Boris Ravignon, Acting Chairman and CEO of ADEME, is responsible for using the data.

## Who hosts Nos Gestes Climat?

Nos Gestes Climat is hosted by Vercel. Vercel is an American company based in Covina, California: https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy

article 82 of law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978. Cookies that are not strictly necessary for the service or whose sole purpose is to facilitate communication by electronic means must be consented to by the user.
This consent by the data subject for one or more specific purposes constitutes a legal basis within the meaning of the RGPD and must be understood within the meaning of article 6-a of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

Nos Gestes Climat uses Matomo anonymously and therefore does not require consent in accordance with the recommendations of the CNIL. This means that your IP address, for example, is anonymised before being recorded. It is therefore impossible to associate your visits to this site with your person.
It should be noted that :

- The data collected is not cross-referenced with any other processing

## More details on the data processed

### a) Simulation data

The data entered during the simulation is stored locally in the platform user's browser. It is deleted when the user clears the data from their browser or clicks on the "Restart" button on the <a href="/profil">profile page</a>.

As part of the group simulation, each participant is given a random pseudonym (conference mode) or a random identifier (survey mode) in order to remain anonymous.

In this sense, and in accordance with CNIL guidelines, the processing is not considered to be personal data processing.

### b) Data relating to individual simulation results

In particular, we track the address of the page at the end of the simulation, the name of the conference page, which contains the total of your footprint and its breakdown into major categories (transport, housing, etc.), via the open website audience analysis tool Matomo, hosted by data.gouv.fr.

### c) Data relating to the results of the group simulation

As part of the group simulation, participants' results are aggregated with those of other conference participants: the total and the categories (transport, accommodation, etc.). The progress of the simulation from 0 to 1 is also shared.

#### Conference mode

Conference mode is based on peer-to-peer technology: users connected to a given conference via its URL are put in contact via a <a href="https://github.com/yjs/y-webrtc">signalling server</a>. At this stage, no information specific to nosgestesclimat is shared.

During the simulation in conference mode, the results described in the introduction to paragraph c) are shared between each user directly via their Internet connection.

#### Survey mode

The survey mode is based on a server hosted by ADEME via our service provider Scalingo, whose code is
and is available <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-server">on github</a>.

Before any data is shared with our server, users are asked if they wish to take part in the survey mode.

During the simulation in survey mode, the results described in the introduction to paragraph c) are sent to the server, which in turn shares them with each survey user.

The user can exit the survey using the "Exit survey" button. Their data will then be retained in the survey results, but future entries on the site will no longer be sent to the server.

### d) Cookies

Cookies are used to track the use of the simulator, such as pages consulted and time spent, with a view to improving the platform.

### e) Evaluation questions

In order to better understand your expectations, we have added two evaluation questions: at the end of the test, and during the action path. Your aggregated simulation results (total as well as transport, food, housing, miscellaneous) are then recorded alongside your evaluation, anonymously, on a server hosted by ADEME via our service provider Scalingo, whose code will soon be available on github.

## Legal basis for data processing

The data processed in the course of these operations has several legal bases:
- The consent of the data subject for one or more specific purposes within the meaning of Article 6-a of the RGPD and pursuant to Article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/EC as amended;
- The performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller within the meaning of Article 6-e of the GDPR;

These grounds are set out below:

### Data relating to simulation results

This processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller within the meaning of Article 6-e of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
They are used to produce anonymised statistics on the carbon footprint in France.

## Data retention period

### Data relating to the simulation

The data is stored locally on the browser until the user takes action to delete the data from the browser, from the nosgestesclimat.fr domain in particular, or via the <a href="/profil">profile page</a>.

### Data relating to simulation results

The data is anonymised. Once anonymised, the data is no longer considered to be personal data and the regulations relating to the protection of personal data no longer apply. For more information, see <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guide_durees_de_conservation.pdf">the CNIL guide</a>.

### Cookies

Upon withdrawal of consent or within 13 months, in accordance with CNIL recommendations.

### Data subject rights

Once anonymisation has been carried out, the GDPR no longer applies to the anonymised data, which is no longer of a personal nature.

### Recipients of the data

The data controller undertakes to ensure that data is only processed by authorised persons.

### Sub-contractors

Some data is sent to subcontractors to carry out certain tasks. The data controller has ensured that its subcontractors provide adequate guarantees and comply with strict conditions of confidentiality, use and data protection.
