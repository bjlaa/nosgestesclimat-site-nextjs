# Spreading Nos Gestes Climat

Nos Gestes Climat is a public service, its code is <a href="/documentation">free</a> and can be reused by anyone.

We also urge you to share our carbon footprint simulator with others, in a variety of ways - and without requiring development skills!

Find out more about our <a href="/NGC_Kit.diffusion.zip">ambassador distribution kit</a> and all the options available to you below.

Don't hesitate to let us know at <a href="mailto:contact@nosgestesclimat.fr">contact@nosgestesclimat.fr</a> so that we can add you to our <a href="/ambassadeurs">Gallery of Reusers</a>.

## üñ•Ô∏è Would you like to integrate the simulator directly into your website?

Nothing could be simpler! Integrate it as an iframe in a blog post or website simply by adding the line below to your web page.

<script id="nosgestesclimat" src="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/iframe.js"></script>{' '}

Join the many other users of our carbon footprint calculator.

The module will be automatically updated with the <a href="/nouveaut%C3%A9s">latest developments</a>.

To find out more about integration, visit <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/PERSONNALISATION.md">our guide</a>.

## ‚úä Would you like to get your friends and family involved, or the people in your local authority, company or university?

Nos Gestes Climat has been designed to be a tool for mobilising people, and we're delighted to be able to count on you to help us build on this momentum through dedicated campaigns.

Our distribution kit can be used to customise your campaign to encourage your friends and family to carry out their carbon footprint.

To make your campaign more fun, use the "poll" function, which gives you the average carbon footprint of all respondents, overall and by emissions category.

Go to <a href="https://sondages.nosgestesclimat.fr">üèüÔ∏è group mode</a>, choose a room name, share the link or QR code, and launch the challenge!

If you'd like any help with your campaign, or would like to collaborate on its development, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@nosgestesclimat.fr">contact@nosgestesclimat.fr.</a>

## üó£Ô∏è You run climate conferences?

To spice up a conference and get your audience active on their phones, what could be better than letting them simulate their carbon footprint live?

Would you like to estimate the climate footprint of a group of people and/or integrate the simulator into an interactive conference?

The "conference" function is available and perfect for your use!

Go to <a href="https://sondages.nosgestesclimat.fr">üèüÔ∏è group mode</a>, choose a room name, share the link and launch the carbon footprint match!

## üåê If you would like to adapt the simulator to a new territory

The internationalisation of Nos Gestes Climat is complex: it's not just a question of simple language translation, but of implementing a solution that allows the language and calculation model to be adapted to suit the country.

And don't hesitate to contribute, and above all to contact us if you need to at <a href="mailto:contact@nosgestesclimat.fr">contact@nosgestesclimat.fr</a> or directly in a Github issue!

## Just want to help?

Everything is on <a href="https://github.com/datagir/?q=nosgestesclimat">Github</a>, but don't hesitate to contact us directly.

- ambassadors who deploy Nos Gestes Climat as close as possible to the public to help them carry out their carbon assessment
