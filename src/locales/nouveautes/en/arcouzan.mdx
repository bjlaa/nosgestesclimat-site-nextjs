> The only glacier in the Ariège department, the Arcouzan glacier (also known as the Mont Valier glacier) is a small cirque glacier in the Pyrenees. It made headlines on 2 October 2023 when <a href="https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/ariege/foix/decouverte-enigmatique-sur-un-glacier-des-pyrenees-un-sac-a-dos-vieux-de-40-ans-emerge-de-la-glace-2849477.html">a 40-year-old rucksack was discovered inside it</a>!

## 🧮 The calculation model gets even better!

### 🎭 ⚽️ Leisure activities

You can now enter your <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1999">cultural</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2060">sporting</a> hobbies during the test. The footprint associated with each choice is based on a macro-economic approach. The idea is to give an initial estimate of the footprint of the activity in question without going into detail (we don't want, in this version of the test, to ask for the exact number of golf clubs and balls). So, in this approach, part of the national footprint associated with the sector of activity is allocated according to the choice made. Find out more in <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/loisirs">our documentation</a>!

### 🏊‍♀️ Add swimming pool

Perhaps you've already had the opportunity to indicate whether or not you have an in-ground swimming pool? Since <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1948">last July</a>, you can find the footprint of your swimming pool in Nos Gestes Climat, a model developed by <a href="https://futur.eco/calculateur/piscine/empreinte">Futur.eco</a>. To find out more, visit our <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/logement/piscine">documentation</a>!

### 🚬 Tobacco added

A question we've been waiting for since the start of Nos Gestes Climat, or almost... It's now <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1995">included</a>, obviously with all the precautions about the real impact of cigarettes, which is not just "climate". With an extra 100 kgCO₂e for a regular smoker, quitting smoking is a gesture that can count!

### 💸 Overhaul of the "expenditure" question

Asking you to answer about your annual expenditure in € was not a "gift" question.... Many of you answered "I don't know" to this question: we have therefore decided to <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1997">revise this question</a> to offer you 3 choices of answers <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/divers/autres-produits">based on INSEE household expenditure data</a>.

### And other changes

- The <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1993">emissions factor for the French electricity mix</a> has been updated.
- <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2049">Numerous typo corrections</a>.

**We are currently working on <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/issues/2076">a writing charter for our calculation model</a>, with the aim of facilitating the development of the application, as well as helping external integrators to get to grips with the data

## 🙋‍♂ A new "Challenge your friends" feature

Accessible from <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupes">the groups mode</a>, this new feature makes it very easy to compare results with family and friends. The group can be made up of up to 20 people! For groups of more than 20 people, of course, poll and conference modes are still available.

## ❓ New version of the FAQ

As the team has grown over the last few months, we've been able to take up subjects that have been in the bins for several months! Updating our FAQ was one of them, and since <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1181">last July</a> we've been offering you a 'brand new' page that should answer most of <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/questions-frequentes">your questions</a>! Can't find the answer you're looking for? Write to us using the form at the bottom of the page.

## 👥 More complete 'model' profiles

First and foremost to help us with the development of the calculation model and to ensure that the results visualisation components are optimal for the majority of our users, we've improved <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1968">the completeness of our personas</a> and the personas <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1215">visualisation page</a>. Test them out <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/personas">here</a>!

## 👀 New version of the tutorial

The test tutorial is now <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/1227">being improved</a>. We're in an A/B test phase: some of you may already have seen this new tutorial go through! The idea is to validate this new version by observing the statistical improvements associated with this new tutorial. Once validated, this tutorial will be available to everyone!

## 💌 NL

Thank you all for subscribing to the NGC newsletter (more than 50,000 people!) which allows you, in addition to receiving your simulation result by e-mail, to follow the news of the site and in particular the blog with our latest articles: one presenting <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/feuille-de-route">our roadmap for the coming months</a>, the other concerning the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/maladaptation">concept of "maladptation"</a>

## 🫶 Thank you for your contributions

### 🇨🇦 Added Canada (Quebec)

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/davidson-canada-devops">Alexandre Thieve</a>, who made it possible to put a Quebec version of the test online by <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2000">contributing directly</a> to our repository!

## 🪲 Various tech topics and bugs

### ⚙️ Publicodes-tools

Nos Gestes Climat's approach is also to enable as many people as possible to get to grips with the calculation model! So we're working on a complete toolkit around the forms generated via Publicodes to help more potential reintegrators of the UCS model. A first brick is available with <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/publicodes-tools">Publicodes-tools</a>, <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/2006">used by NGC for the model compilation scripts</a>).

### ✨ Order in the units

Major work on the 'units' of the calculation model was carried out this summer. The aim? To guarantee a reliable model by adding a check on calculations via the homogeneity of calculations. All of the work carried out is described in <a href="https://accelerateur-transition-ecologique-ademe.notion.site/De-l-ordre-dans-la-gestion-des-unit-s-9331ddfd965741bfb2628504afd5dfc1?pvs=4">this technical article</a>!

**But also ...:**

- The arrival of a <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">dedicated</a> and more clearly identified <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">contact page</a>.
- The addition of a<a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/budget">page on the team's budget</a> for even greater transparency.
- A <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/demo-iframesimulation">new way of integrating Nos Gestes Climat in iframe</a>, with the option of displaying the test directly without the static content being directly accessible. Use case? The canton of Geneva, which is currently creating its own site, but uses Nos Gestes Climat for the carbon footprint test!

💡 As a reminder, all developments to the Nos Gestes Climat public service are carried out transparently on the Github platform, both <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/">on the site side</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat">on the calculation model side</a>.

See you soon for some great new features!
