## Our Climate Gestures, v1

> In a nutshell:
&gt
> The action screen has been completely redesigned with two paths and more gestures
> The application has been partly redesigned: it's more modern and pleasant to use, especially on mobile phones
> We're introducing _personas_ to help you work on your next actions
> - share your simulation results on networks, and people will see a snapshot of your results straight away!

## Take action

We've completely redesigned the /actions screen.

You now have access to two modes, a guided mode in which the actions are sorted by you, and a standalone mode in which you can tackle the biggest reduction actions.

The selection of actions is now more complete, with 17 in all categories.

## Redesign of the application, especially on mobile

- we've adopted the conventions of the modern mobile, with finger-accessible navigation buttons at the bottom, and a session bar that gives the simulation result also at the bottom and permanently visible

- on the action screen, the session bar remains predictable, in the same place but with the colour of the category

- we've gained vertical space on mobile. Why is this important? To make phones &lt; 6 inches last. Not because 6 inches is bad, but because changing phones just for the screen is a shame. It's not going to revolutionise our footprint, but it's something!

## Simulation sharing

A big new feature is the ability to preview the results of a simulation when sharing it on social networks.
We hope to improve the application's distribution. Below is a Whatsapp capture.

See &lt;a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/208">this PR&lt;/a>.

## Introducing personas

This system, to be populated with profiles that are as representative of the population as possible, will enable us to better test and develop the application.

## Bug fixes

We've fixed a major bug: the "previous" button in the simulation was not working properly. We've removed it, fixed the same problem that affected the "my answers" button, which now becomes the only way to change your answers. It has been widely promoted.
