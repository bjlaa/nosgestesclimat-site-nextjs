## Improving our presentation component

For the tutorial, and the end screen, we monitor the rate at which slides are played. We've made the next button more obvious via an animation, and now display slides as circles above the slides.

Its performance on the end screen has also been improved, for smaller processors. 


## New instruction sheets 

We've added comprehensive fact sheets to explore in more depth what you can do for your digital footprint, via telecommuting, for your personal savings, and so on.

## Other improvements

We're starting to work on indexing the site on search engines, and making incremental improvements to the calculation model.
