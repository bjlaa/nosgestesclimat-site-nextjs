> In brief: the nosgestesclimat.fr calculation engine has been completely modernised

In this version, not much changes for users, and that's even the aim: to completely overhaul the underlying code without introducing any :bug: .

Nos Gestes Climat is now cleanly based on publi.codes. So we've made up for the 8 months of improvements that the betagouv/my-company team made to this language, and removed the mountain of code that was publicodes and that we weren't actively developing here :+1:

So we're one step closer to making the calculation model we're developing here more open, readable and reproducible, and one step closer to an individual climate footprint calculation model that will serve as a benchmark.
