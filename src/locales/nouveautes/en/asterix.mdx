> Summary :
&gt
> We have reworked the question on household appliances, asking for a list of appliances rather than an annual expenditure, and made the calculations more reliable
> We have launched the 'conference' function on the home page

## Footprint of household appliances

We're moving on from a monetary factor to a list of possessions.

So we were probably overestimating the default footprint of household appliances by a lot, as noted <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/issues/948">here</a>.

Conversely, this new version prevents users from forgetting recent purchases, by offering them a list that isn't complete, but is already quite extensive.

We also overestimated the footprint of household appliances, because it was attributed entirely to the individual. We now divide it by the number of people living in the home.

## Launch of conference mode in the foreground

The feature is now open to everyone, on the home page.

It allows friends, colleagues and workgroups to calculate their footprint together, interactively.

A new guide will help you understand the principle before you get started.

Room names in French are automatically generated, so you don't have to worry about finding the right name.

Other bugs in the conference mode have been fixed.
