## NGC international üó∫Ô∏è

We're launching internationalisation and regionalisation with <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/626">our first new territory: Guadeloupe</a>!

This essential work, which we had put aside for the moment, was motivated by the initiative of <a href="https://molokoi.com/">MOLOKO√è</a>, a company committed to fighting climate change in its region, and <a href="https://gp.linkedin.com/in/samuel-charvet-830773223">Samuel Charvet</a>, a student at the University of the West Indies in Point-√†-Pitre.

The main features of the Guadeloupe version are the customisation of the electricity mix factor, localised suggestions for air travel and the addition of the inter-island ferry service, all of which will obviously continue to evolve.

This is just the first building block, our aim being to create a community of contributors first in France, then in Europe and around the world.

## Air conditioning added ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Differentiating the model for Guadeloupe has enabled us to realise the importance of air conditioning, and the relative importance of heating (for hot water) in this tropical region where no month is significantly colder than another.

Initially reserved for Guadeloupe, we have extended <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/logement/climatisation">this air conditioning model</a> to mainland France (in fact, the standard model at this stage, because it is historical), given the extent of air conditioning equipment in 2020: 25% of households are expected to have it.

Its footprint is twofold: its electricity consumption (particularly carbon-intensive in Guadeloupe) _and_ its greenhouse gas leakage, which is significant (several hundred kg of CO2e per air conditioner per year) even in a France with a low-carbon electricity mix.

The subject is complex (as it often is), so this model is just a <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1488">first iteration</a> to be refined.

## Biogas üî•üå±

It's a question that's been asked many times: what about "green gas", also known as biogas and more specifically biomethane?

We investigated<a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/logement/gaz/biogaz">the impact of biogas</a> and validated the possibility of adding it to our calculation, and now it's done.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this is by no means a perfect solution, and should not replace a more sustainable reduction in gas consumption through electrification, sobriety and energy efficiency.

## Heating: average values üå°Ô∏è

A <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1433">study of average heating simulation values</a> has been carried out by carefully analysing the statistics for the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/parc-fran√ßais">French housing stock</a>.

## Tech ‚öôÔ∏è

As you may know, the special feature of ourgestesclimat is that it is a form generated from an <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation">open calculation model</a>. This is what makes it particularly robust to changes, because we don't painstakingly order the questions by hand, and we don't recode entanglements such as "if the user says they live in a flat, then don't ask about the lawnmower": everything is managed for us.

The management of 'mosaic' questions (such as the 'heating' checkboxes or the choice of lunch and dinner menus) has been improved, and now resides directly in <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/docs/mosaic.md">the model,</a> alongside the other questions!

What's in it for you? This allows contributors who don't want to bother with Javascript (and other coding considerations) to modify the questions in a very easy-to-use language.
