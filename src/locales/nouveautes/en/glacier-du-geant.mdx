## English version ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

Hi everyone! Nos Gestes Climat is now available in English ðŸ’‚

Of course, translation is a long-term task, so if you find a problem, we have a page dedicated to feedback :

Soon, it will also be possible to calculate your climate footprint in Spanish, Italian and other languages.

> Please note that translation does not mean internationalisation of the model: for the moment, there are only two calculation models, for mainland France and Guadeloupe. The others are coming soon!

## Brand new figures for the food footprint

We've improved the footprints for lunch and dinner dishes.

Firstly, we have improved the calculation of the emission factor for the most important component of meals, meat and fish. Rather than a simple average, we now calculate an average weighted by national consumption (for example, for the "meat 1" dish, pork and chicken are no longer equally important).

Secondly, in October there was a global update of agribalyse, which corrected some overestimated emission factors. We have updated our figures accordingly.

## Improved navigation during and after the test

It's <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/677">now easier</a> to navigate through the categories and answers already given after the test.

In the same vein, a new `Find my simulation` button has been added to the home page, and the progress of the test in % is shown on the profile page. Find <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/672">out more</a>.

## A new page to explain our fossil fuel dependency

A <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/pÃ©trole-et-gaz">new page</a> to explain the issues involved in reducing our consumption of oil and gas. The climate is just one of them, and we are going through a period where inflation and geopolitical tensions are more and more part of the equation.
