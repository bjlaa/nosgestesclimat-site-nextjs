#The Chiaupe Glacier

What's new in December 2023

>This is it: it's the last winter when skiers will be able to take advantage of the facilities located partly on the Chiaupe glacier, high above La Plagne. Following the accelerated melting of the glacier over the last decade, the decision was taken 3 years ago to dismantle the infrastructures on the resort's upper slopes and lower them 200m below.

## 🎨 A few visual changes to cheer up the eyes and the heart

To give a little boost in this dreary winter (quite warmed up though), our colours are evolving. So welcome to purple 💜 pink 💓 and other goodies! 


At the same time, as you may have noticed, our menus have been redesigned to make them simpler to use:

- A menu, simple and pretty, that fits superbly on mobile!

- A reorganised footer for greater clarity

## 🗣️ A new way to manage your returns

Before, we had a thousand and one ways of receiving your feedback: github, email, contact form, a dedicated form on the Friends page... and it was confusing! But that was before. Now it's all going to happen here, on the new contact page, where you can :

- report bugs
- suggest changes

Unfortunately, we can't respond to all the feedback sent by email because there are so many of them and we're only a very small team, so we try to limit direct contact. However, we do offer a direct contact option somewhere after you fill in the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/contact">contact form</a>:)

Here's what it looks like:

## 👯 You can now modify your friends groups

Have you created too many friend groups, or do you have inactive groups? 
You can now tidy things up 🧹

At the bottom of each Friends group page, you can : 

- delete a group, if you're the admin (i.e. the creator)

- leave a group if you have joined it and wish to leave

   <img width="939" alt="quitter groupe" src="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/assets/144152881/94ad8578-3700-4641-9751-ed32bbed8757">

    

How do I know if I'm a group admin?

Simply look under the group name. If it says "Created by you", you can delete the group. It will be deleted for everyone. If not, your friend is the administrator: you can then leave the group.

## 📊 Improvements to the new end page

We've clarified a few things, including

- added a "save" button to make it easier for you to re-access your simulation in the future
- added a link to the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/">documentation</a> at the bottom of the page to inform you about our calculation methodologies
- added a 'Modify my answers' button to allow you to change certain answers in the event of errors or changes


## 🚶‍♀️ A few changes in passing

- Clear improvements to the simulator's responsive mode: more than half of our users complete the test on their smartphone, and there was room for improvement, to say the least 😅
- Major improvements to the loading performance of our documentation
- A new technical setup for A/B testing to improve the site as closely as possible to your needs
- You can now access the results of your test from your profile page 👀 :

## 🌿 Important changes to our model

- A complete overhaul of the management logic for certain questions (mosaics and Booleans) to standardise the way they work, simplify the code, and make it easier for the user to understand
- Review of the emissions factors for certain elements: addition of the RER to the rail travel and heating calculations
- Added calculation of the impact of any second homes in holiday accommodation
- Improved behaviour in the event of clicking on "I don't know" during the test
- Addition of a Spanish version reviewed and updated by an external contributor, thank you 💃 !
- Our <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/services-soci%C3%A9taux">calculation data on societal services</a> has been updated with the latest calculations from our partner, <a href="https://abc-transitionbascarbone.fr/">ABC</a>
- Our model is now ready in its first version 🍖




## 🪲 Bug fixes of all kinds

- Selected actions now increment correctly on the profile page
- We've fixed the tracking of our pedagogy metric, which you can find on <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/northstar">this page</a>
- The management of detailed routes has been debugged
- Some broken redirections have been repaired



💡 As a reminder, all development of the Nos Gestes Climat public service is done transparently on the Github platform, on <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/">the site side</a> and <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat">on the calculation model side</a>.

See you soon for more news and happy holidays!
