> In brief: Power supply, average footprint and a few bugs

For this 2nd version of Nos Gestes Climat, we've listened to the already numerous feedbacks and made these main changes.

## Food item

We've introduced the choice of breakfast type:

As well as a new diet selector, much less rigid than a single diet.

## More representative default values

The simulator now defaults to 11.7 tons, a figure closer to the average footprint of a French person (we were previously at 10). 

## "Finance" item removed

As explained in #24, assigning a footprint to money in the bank was double counting. We've removed it.

## üêõ shared car bug

In short, we were greatly overestimating the footprint of car-sharing.

We now attribute a share of the vehicle's construction to each person who rents a car to get around. We used to make the mistake of attributing *all* the construction to him.
