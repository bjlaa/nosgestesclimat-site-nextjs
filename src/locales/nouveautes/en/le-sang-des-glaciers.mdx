> In spring, the red algae (Sanguina) that circulate on the surface of snow crystals proliferate by absorbing CO2 and cover the snow with a blood-red colour. This colouring reduces the albedo of the snow, speeding up the melting of the snowpack concerned and shortening the duration of the snow cover. This phenomenon seems to be occurring more and more frequently, and is linked to global warming. If you're curious, you may be interested in the <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/environnement-la-neige-rouge-de-plus-en-plus-presente-sur-les-glaciers-du-monde_5857430.html">France Info report from 30 May 2023</a>!

## 🧮 New additions to the calculation model!

### 🏖️ Your holiday accommodation options

Hotel, campsite, holiday rental or home exchange? As the holidays approach, you can now complete your footprint with that of the accommodation you'll be staying in (in addition to caravans and motorhomes).

The <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1888">various discussions on the subject</a> have led to the use of data from the final report on the pre-deployment of environmental labelling for hotels, <a href="https://librairie.ademe.fr/consommer-autrement/4096-projet-de-pre-deploiement-de-l-affichage-environnemental-des-hotels.html">published by ADEME in March 2020</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.betterfly-tourism.com/affichage-environnemental-hotels/">Betterfly Tourism</a>.

### 🚲 Redesign of the "Soft mobility" question

Following your many comments and questions on the subject, we now invite you to select <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1885">your "efficient" modes of transport</a>. The carbon footprint is relatively small, but it is clear that the environmental impact of these vehicles, particularly electric ones, is not negligible in other respects. The idea is to keep this question educational!

### 🛵 New electric scooter option for two-wheelers

The <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1886">electric scooter</a> is now available in the list of motorised two-wheelers! With the added bonus of a "Change to an electric scooter" action if you enter a combustion scooter!

### And other changes

- The "Do without a car for less than 5 km" action is now available to car owners only. https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1880
- The addition of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) / vans of the type Kangoo or Partner up to Trafic and Vito in the car size options. https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1729
- Updating of the price of wood for input help and the emission factor for wood and pellets. https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1739
- Correction of the conversion factor HT/TTC for the question of expenditure on new products. https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/pull/1914

## ⭐️ We're asking for your feedback on Our Climate Gestures!

At the end of the simulation, a banner will appear inviting you to give <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/894">your opinion</a>:

#### Did "Our Climate Gestures" help you learn anything?

/>

#### Does "Our Climate Gestures" make you want to take action to reduce your carbon footprint?

/>

Knowing your carbon footprint is all very well, but it's obviously only the first step in a process that we hope will lead to greater awareness and action! This indicator is invaluable to the team because it enables us to <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/1082">keep this objective in mind</a>, with a view to continuous improvement.

## 💌 Save your simulation by e-mail

You can now retrieve your simulation at any time, via a "magic" link: we've added a form at the end of the simulation allowing you to <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/1022">enter your email address</a> to receive your simulation results by email. This will also enable us to keep you up to date with our latest updates and new features on the site.

## The arrival of the NGC blog

It's about time! Three years after Nos Gestes Climat went online, ideas for articles are pouring in, and we have no shortage of subjects to look at, clarify and explain the notion of individual carbon footprints, but that's not all! So we've set <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/718">up a blog</a>, which you can <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog">find here</a>.

## 📊 The stats page is evolving

New indicators have been added to <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/stats">our public statistics page</a>, including the number of simulations completed!
