it's at the National Assembly in the 7th arrondissement of Paris that the State budget is voted each year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/205978955-88a0ad61-244c-4afb-89a9-600eef3a5f1c.jpg)

If you've ever done a carbon footprint test, you may have noticed a rather surprising category: public services. Around 1 tonne out of the French average of 10 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë may not seem like much... Only, for those who adopt a rather low-carbon lifestyle, and more generally in relation to the target of 2 tonnes of individual footprint (remember that the important thing is not the target but the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/blog/budget">transition scenario</a>, 1 tonne can legitimately look like an elephant in the room!

In this article, we tell you all about this famous "public services" or now "societal services" item in NGC: how it is calculated, what it is made up of, and how we have just used these figures to make a **‚ú® new version of the nosgestesclimat.fr** calculation model.

## The average French person emits 8.9 tonnes (November 2022)

France, like many other countries, has set itself commitments to reduce its climate footprint and has defined <a href="https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/strategie-nationale-bas-carbone-snbc">a strategy</a> to achieve this.

To achieve this, we obviously need to know _where we stand_ today and how things are evolving each year.

This is the task of the French Ministry of Ecology's <a href="https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/">Data and Statistical Studies Department</a>, which <a href="https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286">estimates it at 8.9 tonnes per person in 2021</a>.

How is this figure calculated? The method of calculation is <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/files/9980633/methodologie_empreinte_carbone_octobre2021_0.pdf">clever and transparent, but relatively difficult to understand</a>, so we'll try to explain it more simply here.

Basically, to calculate a climate footprint, you have to start from a physical reality. We have to calculate the actual greenhouse gas emissions (or at least estimate them) of a concrete action: for example, we know that burning 1 litre of petrol in a car emits around <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/transport/voiture/thermique/empreinte-au-litre">2.7 kg of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë.</a> Then we can count the litres of diesel burnt by French semi-trailers, by barges on rivers, by boats, aeroplanes and so on.

The problem, then, is to derive the footprint of other sectors, which do not burn these fossil fuels directly. For example, a hospital buys wooden furniture but does not manufacture or transport it itself. The furniture is cut in a factory, which has purchased it. A lorry delivered planks of wood. This wood has been treated by the chemical industry, and produced by the forestry sector (the management of forest wood), which uses diesel chainsaws, etc.

The government does not have a precise description of all these transactions (kg of wood, volume of oil and paint, etc.), but it does have the exchanges in ‚Ç¨ between all these sectors, at an aggregated level over the year, known as the macro level. Thanks to these monetary exchanges, a matrix calculation can be used to assign each sector the carbon footprint of its added value!

To put it simply: we obtain an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions according to which sector bought from which other sector. To return to our hospital example, we can therefore estimate the carbon footprint of the health sector, even if the exact details of each hospital's consumption are not known.

These calculations are made periodically. The latest accurate version is for 2017, and the latest (less accurate) estimate is for 2021.

## Define the perimeter of a base allocated to each French person

Summing up the footprint of all these sectors, divided by the country's population, gives <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/empreinte-SDES">the</a> so-called "macro" <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/empreinte-SDES">footprint</a> per person.

At the same time, the nosgestesclimat calculation model is a compilation of so-called "micro" models: you are asked a multitude of questions to reconstruct your carbon footprint based on physical consumption data.

> These are two perspectives on the same physical reality, two very different methods producing two figures, which fortunately converge around 9 tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ‚Çë.

These two methods are very different, but are nonetheless complementary: in fact, analysis by consumption cannot capture all the emissions of a French person. While the nosgestesclimat micro method makes it easy to calculate the footprint of your car mileage, it is quite incapable of estimating the footprint of the public services that you use on a diffuse basis all year round, as well as commercial services such as the fibre and mobile internet network that most of the population benefit from (albeit to varying degrees) on a latent basis. We therefore need to adopt a hybrid model that mixes the micro and the macro.

> The photo at the top of this article illustrates the problem: it's easy to estimate the climate footprint of a lorry, car or motorbike. But what about the footprint of this road, which is regularly repaved? The maintenance of road signs? The operating footprint of the National Assembly itself?

The aim then is to define the perimeter of these complementary worlds to avoid double counting as much as possible, and thus obtain the final value of the constant societal services, the sum of public services and commercial services, attributed to each French person.

## A first calculation

We have therefore analysed the macro footprint data <a href="https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/la-decomposition-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-demande-finale-de-la-france-par-postes-de-consommation">shared by the SDES</a>, sector by sector, line by line, to include a share, from 0 to 100%, of the footprint of societal services.

> It should be remembered that the aim is always to **obtain orders of magnitude**: it is not a question of claiming a result to the nearest ten kg of CO2. In this respect, it should be remembered that our climate objectives target a 90% reduction in our footprint.

The "Public administration and defence" line obviously includes 100% of public services as a matter of course: the only way citizens can influence these government departments is through their vote and their public commitment. The same applies to the "Education" line.

On the other hand, things are more complicated for the "üèóÔ∏è construction" item, for example: it includes many different activities that benefit society as a whole, but we don't have details of their carbon footprint. An allocation is therefore made on the basis of the turnover of the sub-branches and sub-sub-branches <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092">published by INSEE</a>, and these are the % figures that you can see in our documentation.

> The data provided by the SDES gives a carbon footprint corresponding to what is consumed on French territory by economic branch (e.g. E36 = water distribution network = 677 kTCO‚ÇÇ‚Çë) or by group of economic branches (e.g. F41_43 = Construction = 54116 kTCO‚ÇÇ‚Çë). For this data, there is therefore a first level of aggregation which we have chosen to disaggregate according to the <a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092">branch's</a> share of turnover in the grouping proposed by the SDES (e.g. for F41_43, we have F41=25%, F42=13.5%, F43=61.5%)
&gt
> Some of the data is secret, and we have made the assumption that this data is also secret for the calculation of the national carbon footprint. In the absence of additional information, we have chosen not to consider them in these decomposition calculations.
&gt
> To go even further, we sometimes needed a higher level of precision by looking at the economic sub-branches. In fact, if we take the example of E38 relating to waste collection, only sub-branches E3812 and E3822, concerning hazardous waste, were to be included in public services. We have therefore also used the breakdown by turnover to bring out the carbon intensity associated with the sub-branches in question within E38.

As far as market services are concerned, we have tried to include in the basic footprint consumption that is relatively universal (for example, everyone has to take out home insurance) or that is not yet taken into account by our micro models (for example, the consumption of telecommunications services) but which may be one day.

If you're interested, you can explore our documentation explaining and justifying this allocation via the <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/services-publics">public services</a> and <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-marchands">market services</a> pages. We've done our best for a first version, but your feedback will be invaluable.

## The result

Here's a photograph of our hybrid model.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this graph does not represent a reliable average value for the climate footprint of a French person, <a href="https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286">contrary to the SDES figure of 8.9t</a>, but simply the anatomy of our hybrid calculation model. The values are likely to change regularly, in full transparency.

The aim of Nos Gestes Climat remains to estimate the footprint associated with a real person's lifestyle. In this respect, the aim of future versions is to cover many items that have been left out for the time being üêïÔ∏è‚õ¥Ô∏èüõµ‚ö°Ô∏èüè°. See you soon!
