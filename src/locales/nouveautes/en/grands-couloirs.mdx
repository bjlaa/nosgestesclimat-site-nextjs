> In short: we listen to all your feedback, and we're constantly improving 🔄


## 👂 We're listening! 

We've sorted and responded to over 300 pieces of feedback since the launch of Nos Gestes Climat, all on the ' <a href="https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/issues">issues' tab</a>.

This allows us to understand the calculator's problems and prioritize improvements.

## Some simulation improvements

🚴 Cyclosphere, hello! The issue of cycling makes its appearance in the simulator, and in the action "go to work other than by car", which replaces "go to work by public transport". Walking 🚶‍♀️ and other modes of transport are not forgotten, of course 🛴.

We'll let you guess the impact of this quesiton on the results ;) 

We've also improved the input guides (e.g. number of dwellings: with or without me?)

🤳 The phone question has been revised, now that all recent phones are over 5 inches, and to take into account the 'no smartphone' option.

🔥🌲 The question of heating in steres of wood becomes more relevant: it's counted in steres, not kWh. We'll be continuing to improve the other entries soon (wood pellets, fuel oil).

## Other improvements 

New features (like this one you're reading) now appear directly on https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveautés, which is still more accessible than <a href="https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/releases">on github</a> 🙂 


🐛 Several rather important bugs have been resolved thanks to your feedback (simulation end always at 11 tons, default value input -> no "next" button, etc.)

## Our roadmap

Now that the "issues" onget is clearer, it was time to put our simulator/calculation model roadmap online, in the <a href="https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/projects/1">"Projects" section</a>. It's all indicative, but it lets you know what we're currently working on. 

> As for the interface, this is the <a href="https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-climat/milestones">place</a> to go to follow our progress.
