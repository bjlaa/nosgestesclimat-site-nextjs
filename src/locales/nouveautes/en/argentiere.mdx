> In brief: introduction of action sheets and a better car model

## Integration of action sheets 

After the simulation, we now offer you a list of actions that will significantly reduce your footprint.

We've also included detailed documentation for each of these actions.

## Big model improvement: vehicle construction ðŸš— 

It's now amortized over several years. Previously, it was depreciated over age, so an electric car bought 1 year ago would see its 12 tons attributed all at once to that first year, among other problems. 

The depreciation method is explained <a href="https://ecolab.ademe.fr/apps/climat/documentation/transport/voiture/amortissement-particulier">here</a>.

We also forgot to divide the vehicle's construction by the number of passengers, as was done for car use.

See #674 for all the thinking behind it.

## Other improvements âœ¨ 

We specify that we are asking for the household's energy consumption, not the individual's. We're thinking in particular of collocs who may each have their own amount in mind.

We've improved the texts of the questions on cars, and better documented the calculations.
