## A new path to action üéØ

Many users complained about the simplicity of our action path. We've completely redesigned it, bringing it closer to a mini-game where the objective is to reduce your footprint. 

![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)

This is just the beginning: we've already planned the <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359">next steps</a> to make it even easier to get involved.

We're also introducing *personas*: typical profiles that you can select to experience the action course as a given citizen. 

## The menu üêüÔ∏è

We've received dozens of requests to integrate a fish menu on the diet choice screen. There are now 2!

These new dishes have been created using the <a href="https://agribalyse.fr/">Agribalyse</a> database, and the calculation is of course *open*. We'll be bringing you lots more food news in the near future. 

## A new menu for the application 

Nosgestesclimat is designed to be used on both mobile and desktop devices. The mobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and the desktop version a new two-column layout, with a menu also on the left.

This new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one of many accessibility improvements we have <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350">planned</a>.

## French average rises to 9 tons! 

Unfortunately, this does not reflect any unexpected efforts, but an improvement in the Ministry of the Environment's calculation method. 

The good news is that the French administration is taking the matter seriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences scientifically. 

Detailed explanations <a href="https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885">here</a>.

So why do we show an average of 9.8 tonnes in the simulator? Because our calculation is based on a different, complementary method to that used by the government. Find out more <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261">here</a>.


## Conference mode improvements üèüÔ∏è

This collective mode of using ourgestesclimat is increasingly popular. To make it easier to share the link at the start of the conference, we've generated a super QRCode that you just have to project or send by e-mail
![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png). 

Another improvement is the exclusion from the group's results of simulations that have resulted in a footprint that is too large, i.e. over 100 tonnes. This limit will soon be configurable. 

## Technical improvements üêá

We're continuing to streamline the site, by removing a graphic animation library (react-spring) and better separating the conference mode from the rest of the application. 

Of course, many of the bugs reported have also been corrected.
