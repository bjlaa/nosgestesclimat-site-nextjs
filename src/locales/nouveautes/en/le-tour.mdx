*The Glacier du Tour is located in the Chamonix valley, a valley accessible by a superb mountain TER*


## Unpack your wardrobe

Finally, we no longer ask you the question of *expenditure* on textiles each year, which was too sensitive to the quality of the purchases. Instead of counting 50kg CO2e for a t-shirt bought for €100, we count the t-shirt's footprint.

In return, it's up to you to catalog what you buy in general each year (or on average each year). Not such a simple exercise... but rather interesting, don't you think?

## Viewing sub-categories

As you go through the questions in the simulation, visualize the sub-category footprint at a glance.

## Back button return

We had removed this button because it led to bugs, questions skipping and falling definitively into oblivion. Following numerous requests, it's back, and normally bug-free!

## For those who heat with oil 🛢️

We've quietly changed the main input from kWh to liters. 
Of course, you can still enter the price. We estimate consumption in liters at the quarterly rate published by the Ministry.

## New personas.

We haven't communicated much about this feature, but nosgestesclimat is now equipped with a `Personas` page, which lets you put yourself in the shoes of any individual to see their simulation results. It's here, and we've added a few more: nosgestesclimat.fr/personas

> This improved page could become very important in the future: personas could be designed to be representative of the French people.

## Various improvements

We always listen carefully to your feedback! 

### Input aids

we've improved the airplane input help for those who don't fly every year ([details here](
https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/commit/e3d74925b8ff31d6cf40531e6a07a1f97c9f1237)), and accommodation to accommodate less conventional lifestyles (camping car, truck, houseboat, <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/commit/e900598708402620bc3664500db4c1d111f24515">details here</a>.

### End screen

We've added the decimal to the final test score on the end screen
