the Glacier du Tour is located in the Chamonix valley, a valley that is accessible thanks to a superb mountain TER_

## Unpack your wardrobe

Finally, we no longer ask you the question of _expenditure_ on textiles each year, which was too sensitive to the quality of the purchases. Instead of counting 50kg CO2e for a t-shirt bought for €100, we count the t-shirt's footprint.

In return, it's up to you to catalogue what you buy in general each year (or on average each year). It's not such a simple exercise... but it's pretty interesting, isn't it?

## Viewing sub-categories

As you go through the questions in the simulation, you can see the footprint of the sub-categories at a glance.

## Back button

We had removed this button because it was leading to bugs, questions were skipping and definitely falling into the void. Following numerous requests, it's back and normally bug-free!

## For those who heat with oil 🛢️

We've slowly changed the main input from kWh to litres.
Of course, you can still enter the price. We estimate consumption in litres at the quarterly rate published by the Ministry.

## New personas.

We haven't communicated much about this feature, but nosgestesclimat now has a 'Personas' page, which lets you put yourself in the shoes of any individual to see their simulation results. It's here, and we've added a few more: nosgestesclimat.fr/personas

> This improved page could become very important in the future: personas could be designed to be representative of the French people.

## Various improvements

We always listen carefully to your feedback!

### Input aids

we've improved the help for entering air travel for those who don't take it every year <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/commit/e3d74925b8ff31d6cf40531e6a07a1f97c9f1237">(details here</a>), and accommodation to accommodate less traditional lifestyles (camping car, lorry, houseboat, <a href="https://github.com/incubateur-ademe/nosgestesclimat/commit/e900598708402620bc3664500db4c1d111f24515">details here</a>.

### End screen

We've added the decimal to the final test score on the end screen
