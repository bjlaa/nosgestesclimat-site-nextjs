# `useInternalEngine` Hook

The `useInternalEngine` hook is designed to initialize and manage an instance of the `Engine` based on a given set of rules. It also provides utility functions for evaluating rules and retrieving rule data safely.

## Usage

```typescript
import { useInternalEngine } from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/simulationProvider/useInternalEngine'
import { Rules } from '@/publicodes-state/types'

const rules: Rules = { /* your rules here */ }
const { engine, pristineEngine, safeEvaluate, safeGetRule } = useInternalEngine(rules)
```

## Parameters

- **`rules`** (`Rules`): An object containing the rules to initialize the engine with.

## Returns

- **`engine`**: The initialized instance of the `Engine` for evaluating and working with the rules.
- **`pristineEngine`**: A fresh instance of the `Engine`, unmodified by any interactions.
- **`safeEvaluate`**: A utility function to safely evaluate rules.
- **`safeGetRule`**: A utility function to safely retrieve a specific rule.

## Description

The `useInternalEngine` hook creates an `Engine` instance using the provided rules and exposes methods for rule evaluation and retrieval. This setup is ideal for scenarios where you need to work with a rule engine while ensuring safe operations and easy access to rule data.
