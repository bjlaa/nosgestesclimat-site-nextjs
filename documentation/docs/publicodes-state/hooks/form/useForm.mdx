# `useForm`

The `useForm` hook manages the state and navigation of a form within a simulation. It provides utilities for handling questions, categories, and navigation between them.

## Usage

```typescript
import useForm from 'path/to/useForm';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    relevantQuestions,
    currentQuestion,
    currentCategory,
    setCurrentQuestion,
    setCurrentCategory,
    gotoPrevQuestion,
    gotoNextQuestion,
    noPrevQuestion,
    noNextQuestion,
    isFirstQuestionOfCategory,
    isLastQuestionOfCategory,
    remainingQuestions,
    relevantAnsweredQuestions,
    remainingQuestionsByCategories,
  } = useForm();

  // Use the returned values and functions in your component
}
```

## Returned Values

### Navigation

- `currentQuestion`: The question currently being displayed.
- `currentCategory`: The category of the current question.
- `setCurrentQuestion`: Function to set the current question.
- `setCurrentCategory`: Function to set the current category.
- `gotoPrevQuestion`: Function to navigate to the previous question.
- `gotoNextQuestion`: Function to navigate to the next question.

### State Indicators

- `noNextQuestion`: Boolean indicating if there is no next question.
- `isFirstQuestionOfCategory`: Boolean indicating if the current question is the first in its category.

### Question Collections

- `relevantQuestions`: Array of all questions (answered and unanswered) to be displayed in the form.
- `remainingQuestions`: Array of questions that have not yet been answered.
- `relevantAnsweredQuestions`: Array of questions that have been answered and are relevant.
- `remainingQuestionsByCategories`: Object with categories as keys and arrays of remaining questions as values.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the `useForm` hook to create a basic form navigation:

```typescript
import useForm from 'path/to/useForm';

function FormNavigation() {
  const {
    currentQuestion,
    gotoPrevQuestion,
    gotoNextQuestion,
    noPrevQuestion,
    noNextQuestion,
  } = useForm();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{currentQuestion.title}</h2>
      {/* Render question content here */}
      <div>
        <button onClick={gotoPrevQuestion} disabled={noPrevQuestion}>
          Previous
        </button>
        <button onClick={gotoNextQuestion} disabled={noNextQuestion}>
          Next
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
