# `usePersistentTutorials`

This hook is used to manage the persistence of tutorials in local storage. It ensures that tutorials are loaded from local storage when the component mounts and saved back to local storage whenever they are updated.

## Usage

### Parameters

- **`storageKey`**: (string) The key for the local storage where the tutorials data should be stored.

### Example

```typescript
import usePersistentTutorials from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/userProvider/usePersistentTutorials';

function MyComponent() {
  const { tutorials, setTutorials } = usePersistentTutorials({ storageKey: 'tutorials-key' });

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render tutorials */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Behavior

1. On mount, the hook checks if local storage is available.
2. If available, it retrieves the tutorials data from local storage using the specified [`storageKey`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22storageKey%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FuseOldLocalStorage.mdx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FuseOldLocalStorage.mdx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FuseOldLocalStorage.mdx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentSimulations.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentSimulations.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentSimulations.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentTutorials.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentTutorials.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentTutorials.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentUser.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentUser.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2FuserProvider%2FusePersistentUser.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
