# `useUpdateOldLocalStorage`

This hook is used to migrate data from an old local storage key to a new one. It ensures that the new local storage key is populated only if it is currently empty and the old storage does not contain a "persona".

## Usage

### Parameters

- **`storageKey`**: (string) The key for the new local storage where the data should be migrated.

### Example

```typescript
import useUpdateOldLocalStorage from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/userProvider/useOldLocalStorage';

function MyComponent() {
  useUpdateOldLocalStorage({ storageKey: 'new-storage-key' });

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

### Behavior

1. Retrieves data from the old local storage key `'ecolab-climat::persisted-simulation::v2'`.
2. Checks if the new local storage specified by `storageKey` is empty.
3. If the old local storage does not contain a "persona" and the new local storage is empty, it migrates the data to the new storage key.
4. Removes the old local storage key after migration.

### Notes

- The hook uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the migration on component mount.
- Ensure that the `storageKey` provided is unique and does not conflict with other keys in local storage.
