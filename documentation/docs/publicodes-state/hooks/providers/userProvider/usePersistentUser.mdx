# `usePersistentUser`

This hook manages the persistence of user data in local storage. It ensures that user data is loaded from local storage when the component mounts and saved back to local storage whenever it is updated.

## Usage

### Parameters

- **`storageKey`**: (string) The key for the local storage where the user data should be stored.
- **`initialRegion`**: (RegionFromGeolocation) The initial region data for the user.

### Returns

- **`user`**: (User) The current user data.
- **`setUser`**: (function) Function to update the user data.

### Example

```typescript
import usePersistentUser from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/userProvider/usePersistentUser';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, setUser } = usePersistentUser({ storageKey: 'user-key', initialRegion: { code: 'US', name: 'United States' } });

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render user information */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Behavior

1. On mount, the hook checks if local storage is available.
2. If user data is found in local storage, it is loaded and formatted.
3. If no user data is found, a new user is created with the initial region and a generated user ID.
4. User data is saved back to local storage whenever it is updated.
