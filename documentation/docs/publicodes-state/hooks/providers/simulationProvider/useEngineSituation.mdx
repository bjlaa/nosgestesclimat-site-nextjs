# `useEngineSituation`

The `useEngineSituation` hook is designed for managing the interaction between an `Engine` instance and the simulation situation. It provides utilities to initialize the engine with a given situation and to update the situation as needed.

## Role

This hook ensures:
- The engine is initialized with the current simulation state.
- You can modify the simulation state by adding new data.

## Usage

```typescript
import { useEngineSituation } from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/simulationProvider/useEngineSituation';
import Engine from 'publicodes';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const engine = new Engine();
  const { isEngineInitialized, addToEngineSituation } = useEngineSituation({ engine });

  const handleAddSituation = () => {
    const newSituation = { /* new situation data */ };
    const updatedSituation = addToEngineSituation(newSituation);
    console.log(updatedSituation);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Engine Initialized: {isEngineInitialized.toString()}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAddSituation}>Add to Situation</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Parameters

- `engine` (`Engine`): An instance of the `Engine` class from `publicodes`. This is used to initialize and manage the simulation state.

## Return Values

- `isEngineInitialized` (`boolean`): Indicates whether the engine has been successfully initialized with the simulation situation.
- `addToEngineSituation` (`function`): A function to update the current simulation state with new data. It takes the new situation data as an argument and returns the updated situation.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `engine` parameter is correctly instantiated before passing it to the hook.
- The hook should be used within a React functional component.

This hook is part of the `publicodes-state` library and is intended to simplify the management of simulation states in a React environment.
