It uses memoization to enhance performance by caching the results of complex computations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { useRules } from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/simulationProvider/useRules'
import Engine from 'publicodes'

const engine = new Engine(/* your rules here */)
const root = 'rootRuleName'

const {
  parsedRules,
  everyRules,
  everyInactiveRules,
  everyQuestions,
  everyNotifications,
  everyUiCategories,
  everyMosaicChildrenWithParent,
  rawMissingVariables,
} = useRules({ engine, root })
```
