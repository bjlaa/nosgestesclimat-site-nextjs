# `useActions`

The `useActions` hook provides functionalities for managing and displaying actions within a simulation context. It enables you to access and sort actions based on their numeric values and categorize them into chosen and declined actions.

## Usage

```typescript
import useActions from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/actions/useActions';

const { actions, orderedActions, chosenActions, declinedActions } = useActions({ metric });
```

### Parameters

- **`metric`** (optional): An object of type `Metric` used to configure the engine.

### Returns

- **`actions`**: An array of action names.
- **`orderedActions`**: An array of action names ordered by their numeric values in descending order.
- **`chosenActions`**: An array of action names that have been chosen.
- **`declinedActions`**: An array of action names that have been declined.

## Example

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import useActions from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/actions/useActions';
import { carboneMetric } from '@/constants/metric';

const ActionsComponent = () => {
  const { actions, orderedActions, chosenActions, declinedActions } = useActions({ metric: carboneMetric });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Ordered Actions</h2>
      <ul>
        {orderedActions.map(action => (
          <li key={action}>{action}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <h2>Chosen Actions</h2>
      <ul>
        {chosenActions.map(action => (
          <li key={action}>{action}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <h2>Declined Actions</h2>
      <ul>
        {declinedActions.map(action => (
          <li key={action}>{action}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ActionsComponent;
```

## Implementation Details

The hook relies on the following:
- `useContext` to access the `SimulationContext`.
- `useEngine` to retrieve the numeric values of actions.

### Action Sorting

The `orderedActions` are sorted based on their numeric values, which are obtained using the `useEngine` hook. This allows for prioritizing actions based on their potential impact.

### Action Categories

Actions are categorized into `chosenActions` and `declinedActions` based on user interactions within the simulation. This categorization helps in tracking user decisions and preferences.
