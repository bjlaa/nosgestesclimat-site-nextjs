# `useProgression` Hook

The `useProgression` hook is designed to manage the state and progression of a simulation by categorizing remaining questions and updating the current simulation state.

## Parameters

- **`categories`** (`string[]`): An array of categories for the questions.
- **`remainingQuestions`** (`string[]`): An array of questions that are yet to be answered.
- **`relevantQuestions`** (`string[]`): An array of all relevant questions for the current simulation.
- **`updateCurrentSimulation`** (`function`): A function to update the current simulation with the new progression.

## Return Value

- **`remainingQuestionsByCategories`** (`{ [key: string]: string[] }`): An object mapping each category to a list of remaining questions in that category.

## Example

```typescript
import useProgression from '@/publicodes-state/providers/formProvider/useProgression'

const categories = ['cat1', 'cat2']
const remainingQuestions = ['q1', 'q2', 'q3']
const relevantQuestions = ['q1', 'q2', 'q3', 'q4']
const updateCurrentSimulation = (simulation) => {
  // Logic to update the simulation
}

const { remainingQuestionsByCategories } = useProgression({
  categories,
  remainingQuestions,
  relevantQuestions,
  updateCurrentSimulation,
})
```

## Explanation

The `useProgression` hook calculates the progression of the simulation by organizing remaining questions by category and updating the current simulation state based on the number of relevant and remaining questions.
