# `FormContext`

This folder contains the components and contexts necessary to manage forms within the scope of simulations. The files in this folder allow for the creation and management of form state in a secure and efficient manner.

## Files

### `index.tsx`

This file exports the main component `FormProvider`, used to encapsulate forms in simulations. This component checks if the root is valid before rendering the form. If the root is not valid, the user is redirected to a 404 page.

#### Usage

```tsx
import FailSafeFormProvider from '@/publicodes-state/providers/formProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <FailSafeFormProvider root="bilan">
      {/* Form content */}
    </FailSafeFormProvider>
  );
}
```

This file defines the [`FormContext`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22formContext%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") context which is used to share the form state between different components. This context is essential for enabling centralized and coherent management of form data within the application.

#### Usage

The [`FormContext`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22formContext%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A32%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is mainly used internally by the [`useForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22useForm%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A30%2C%22character%22%3A77%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") hook to access form data in a smooth and reactive manner. Here is an example of using the [`useForm`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22useForm%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fdocumentation%2Fdocs%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fcontexts%2FFormContext.mdx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A30%2C%22character%22%3A77%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") hook in a component:

```tsx
import { useForm } from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/useForm';

function MyFormComponent() {
  const { formData, updateForm } = useForm();

  return (
    <form>
      {/* Usage of formData and updateForm */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

These files are crucial for managing the state of forms in simulations, ensuring that forms are correctly rendered and allowing for efficient sharing of state across different components.
