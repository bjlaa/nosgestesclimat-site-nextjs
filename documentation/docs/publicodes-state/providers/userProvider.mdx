It ensures that these states are accessible and modifiable from any component within the context provider.

## Usage

### Provider

Wrap your application or specific components with the [`UserProvider`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22UserProvider%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FuserProvider%2Findex.tsx%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to make the context available:

```tsx
import UserProvider from '@/publicodes-state/providers/userProvider'

function App() {
  return (
    <UserProvider
      storageKey="yourStorageKey"
      initialRegion={{ code: 'regionCode', name: 'regionName' }}
      migrationInstructions={{ keysToMigrate: {}, valuesToMigrate: {} }}
    >
      <YourComponent />
    </UserProvider>
  )
}
```

### Consumer

Use the [`useUser`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22useUser%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser%2FuseUserDetails.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser%2FuseUserDetails.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fhooks%2Fuser%2FuseUser%2FuseUserDetails.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") hook to access and manipulate the context values:

```tsx
import useUser from '@/publicodes-state/hooks/user/useUser'

function YourComponent() {
  const {
    user,
    updateName,
    updateEmail,
    updateRegion,
    updateUserOrganisation,
    tutorials,
    showTutorial,
    hideTutorial,
    simulations,
    deleteSimulation,
  } = useUser()

  // Example usage
  updateName('New Name')
  hideTutorial('tutorialId')

  return <div>{user.name}</div>
}
