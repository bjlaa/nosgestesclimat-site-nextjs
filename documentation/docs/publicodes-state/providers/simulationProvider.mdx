It is used to share simulation data and methods across different components.

#### Context Definition

The context is defined in [`src/publicodes-state/providers/simulationProvider/context.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbenjaminarias%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2Fnosgestesclimat-site-nextjs%2Fsrc%2Fpublicodes-state%2Fproviders%2FsimulationProvider%2Fcontext.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/benjaminarias/Documents/GitHub/nosgestesclimat-site-nextjs/src/publicodes-state/providers/simulationProvider/context.ts"):

```ts

}

export const SimulationContext = createContext<SimulationContextType>({
